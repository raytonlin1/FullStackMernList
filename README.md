This is a MERN app where I added multiple input fields to be added for each object in the database, and I added the update and delete actions from CRUD. This app allows you to make messages with your name that are stored in a database then displayed on screen. You can create, edit and delete these messages thanks to my additions!

A video demo is uploaded by me at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Tr_cLIB7M.
